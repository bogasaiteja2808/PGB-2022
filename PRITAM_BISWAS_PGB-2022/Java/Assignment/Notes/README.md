### Design Pattern


Association, Aggregation, and Composition in OOP


1.Association (HAS-A )

         Association depicts the relationship between two classes.
         Both of the classes are not dependent on each other.
         They can exist independently. If one is broken, it doesn’t mean the other one also has to be broken.
         
2.Aggregation (Weak Association) (HAS-A Relationship)


         The sub-classes can’t belong to any other base class. Subclasses can stay happily without the base class itself. Classes can exist independently.

         A car and driver have loose coupling in between them.
         Why because a car can exist without a driver and a driver can exist without the car.
         Hence they are not tightly coupled.
         A car can have a driver, but it will still remain a car without the driver driving the car.
         
Composition (Strong Association)(Containment, part-whole, Has-a Relationship) (part of the relationship)

         When both of the classes are dependent on each other, such kind of relationship is called a composition relationship.
         If one goes down, the other will also go down.
         They are dependent on each other. Not like aggregations.

         Key-word to remember: it is composed in the other class. One class is part of another class (dependent on each other)

         (e.g.) Car has an engine. The engine is a part of the car. They are tight coupling. An engine can’t exist without a car. Every car depends on its engine.

         The life of the engine is only until the car is present. The car dies, the engine will also die.




types of design pattern     

    Creational Design Patterns are concerned with the method of creating Objects.
    
    Structural Design Patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects which form larger structures.
    
    Behaviour Design Patterns are concerned with the responsibility and interaction between the objects.
    
    JEE Design Patterns are concerned with providing solutions to the Java EE-based software applications and frameworks.

Creational Design Patterns

    Factory Pattern
    Abstract Factory Pattern
    Singleton Pattern
    Prototype Pattern
    Builder Pattern.
    Object Pool Pattern
    
    
    
    System design 
    
    what ,why
    what happens if we send million request
    
    forward port
    
    tomcat vs ngnix
    
    
    
    what project we are going to work on
    
    why should project should chooose you
    
    
    1. articulation
    
    2. BUssiness / vertical
    
    3. analytical 
    
    4. stick to there standards
    
    dos and dont of ict
    
    5. go through the code base
    
    6. local environment  setup (what is strategy) follow architecture 
    
     (shortcuts) vscode,java ecllipse , intilegent (paid) 
     
     microservice
     
     codebase
 
 
     product vs platform 
     
     
     
     acid complaint rdbms -sql
     
     types of structres - monolithic 
     
     base- no sql
     
     Basically Available soft state 
     
     mongodb
     
     cap(ven diagram)
     
     consistent
     
     availablbe
     
     partial tolerance
