### Day 1 Assignment

Introduction to code versioning(Git) and basic git operation
1. Create git account
2. Install git client in your local system
3. Clone git repository in your local system (https://github.com/coMakeIT-Git/PGB-2022)
4. Add folder named <YOUR_NAME>_PGB2022. For example Srinivas_PGB2022
5. Install eclipse in your local system (Java development IDE)
6. Add java project inside your git folder. For example Srinivas_PGB2022/ProjectGreen
7. Add java class with your name. Add print statement to main method.
8. Add your project folder to git repository
9. Commit your changes
10. Push your changes to remote repository


### Day 2 Assignment

1. Create a class - Take a meaningful class name - e.g. Employee, Country, Student, Birds, Animal and so on
2. Add attributes to class - Add Associated attribute to the class you chosen
3. Add Constructor to Class - Add default and parameterized constructor to class
4. Add getter and setter to Class variables
5. Override equals and hashCode method from object class
6. Add method in class for equality check of class Objects
7. Create two objects of class and do equality check with above method.
8. Showcase method overloading by creating the methods for the class created at step 1
9. Create a class with two functions one recursive and one non recursive. Either of these function should be
capable of calculating the factorial of a number.
10. Create another class to call the factorial methods of class created in step 12 and write the output.
11. Write a Generic class in java.
12. initialize generic class created in step 12 with different data type (For example with String and Integer type)
13. Add a method to the class that returns and print the data when called using generic class object.
14. Commit code to git repository

### Day 3 Assignment

Let's enhance the day 2 assignment

1. Add an Interface
2. Declare 2 methods in interface
3. Add an abstract class
4. Add method with definition in abstract class
5. Implements methods of Interface class in concrete class
6. Override the methods of abstract Class in concrete class
7. create objects of concrete class
8. Access the Abstract class methods
9. Access the Concrete class methods
10. Create collections list, set and map of objects from concrete class
11. Iterate and print list, set and Map build in step 10
12. Sort the collections of list build in step 10
13. use java stream to iterate the list built in step 10
14. Write a program which prints the position of characters occurring in a string
(i.e., which characters occur at which position in a string).
Read the string from the command line.
For example if string is  "Hello World"
{d=[9], o=[4, 6], r=[7], W=[5], H=[0], l=[2, 3, 8], e=[1]}
15. Commit code to git repository


### Day 4 Assignment


 
1. Take input from console in your class method
2. Print the input taken from console. Reads a line of text and prints the integers in the line
3. Calculate the sum of integers taken at step 2.
4. Handle appropriate exceptions(Null pointer, Number format)
5. Add custom exception for your class structure.
6. Use the custom exception written in step 5 to the program written in step 3
7. Propagate the exception to main class.
8. Write a code to generate Runtime exception
9. Write a program to demonstrate the difference between Checked and UnChecked exception in java.
10. Identify a functional Interface in java library and implement it as lambda expression.
11. Write a Custom Functional Interface
12. Implement the method of functional interface as lambda expression.
13. Commit code to git repository



### Day 5 Assignment


1. Add a thread pool in your class. Use Executor framework
2. Implement the Runnable Interface.
3. Build list of objects of your class.
4. Print attributes of your class objects using multiple threads created in step 1
5. Add synchronized block and method in your class
6. Demonstrate the application of Method Reference (Reference To a static Method, Reference to a Instance Method, Reference to a constructor)
7. Create an array of numbers (Mix of prime and composite numbers)
   Convert numbers array to the list
   Use stream.map() to get the list of prime numbers from the numbers
   Use java stream.filter() to take out prime numbers smaller than 25
   Use the stream.sorted() method to sort the numbers in descending order
   Use Reduce to add all the numbers in numbers list
8. Commit code to git repository
